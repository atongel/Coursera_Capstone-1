    "### - Data Cleaning\n",

    "reasonable new values is a better option as far as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other issue is the presence of both numerical and categorical data in the dataset. To this\n",
    "effect, the replacement is done by the frequency for the categorical variables and by mean for\n",
    "the numerical values. The missing categorical values that are replaced by the largest frequency\n",
    "belongs to the columns WEATHER, SPEEDING, LIGHTCOND, ROADCOND,JUNCTIONTYPE, INATTENTIONIND, COLLISIONTYPE, and ADDRTYPE. The missing numeric values in columns X and Y are replaced by the mean of the belonging columns, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "What should be also taken into account, specifically for processing the data in the next steps,is\n",
    "the incompatibility of categorical variables with the predictive model analysis tools. For example, to develop regression models and being able to use packages such as Sklearn, these variables are converted into indicator variables during the data cleaning after handling the missing data."
