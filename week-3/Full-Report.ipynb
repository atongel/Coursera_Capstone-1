    "## Introduction - Business Problem\n",
    "### - Background\n",
    "Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a major public health problem. The annual global status reports on road safety, launched by the World Health Organization (WHO), highlights that the number of road traffic deaths has exceeded one million in recent years. That is over 3000 people dying on the world's roads every day. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this major problem, the volume of research in the areas of accident analysis and prediction has been increasing over the past few decades. [2] The analytical data mining solutions can be largely employed to determine and predict related influential factors and thus\n",
    "to explain RTIs severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, analyzing the various factors that could help predict accident severity can guide the government administration to implement changes in a timely manner that may reduce the number of fatalities & serious injuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Objective\n",
    "The objective of this capstone project is to analyze the collision data set for Seattle, WA and determine the most possible factors including weather, road conditions, visibility, and various other factors that best predict accident severity by training and evaluating supervised machine learning algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will be used to answer the business question: How can the city of Seattle, Washington best predict the severity of collisions that occur and what avenues can be\n",
    "explored to remedy this issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Target Audience \n",
    "The report of this project can be targeted to stakeholders, who are involved with road traffic injuries, such as road administrators, traffic control authorities, and emergency road services in order to help them predict the car accident severities and improve the road users' safety margins."

    "## Data\n",
    "### - Data Source\n",
    "It is now time to understand the data and then prepare it to be fed into the modeling tools. The given dataset used in this project (provided by the coursera example data ) can be downloaded here: https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv \n",
    "\n",
    "The example dataset (Data-Collisions.csv) contains 194673 and 38 columns including the labeled\n",
    "data. The labeled data is the \"Severity Code\", which describes the fatality of an accident. In the shared dataset, the severity code column consists of two values: 1 for property damage and 2\n",
    "for injury. The dataset includes different attributes, describing a variety of conditions: \n",
    "location, weather, light, road, collision types, and so forth that may influence the severity of the accidents. The attributes are of the types of int64, float64, or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Data Balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given dataset, the targeted variable (Severity Code) has more observations in one specific\n",
    "class (1, corresponding to approx. 70% of the collision severity accompanied by property\n",
    "damage ) than the other (2, corresponding to approx. 30% of the collision severity accompanied\n",
    "by injury). Figure 1 shows the initial imbalanced dataset in this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 - Data distribution (imbalanced)  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img  align=\"middle\" src=\"../week-2/figure1_distribution-imbalanced.png\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This imbalanced dataset needs to become firstly balanced, otherwise, the models that will be\n",
    "developed later will be biased. Resampling is a widely adopted technique to address this issue.\n",
    "It consists of randomly removing observations from the majority class to prevent its signal from\n",
    "dominating the learning algorithm (under sampling) or randomly duplicating observations from\n",
    "the minority class to reinforce its signal (over sampling).\n",
    " \n",
    "By under sampling, a large amount of data, which can be later used for the prediction of severity\n",
    "will be lost. Accordingly, the oversampling technique is preferred and implemented in this work.\n",
    "Figure 2 shows the resulting balanced dataset, combining the majority class with over sampled\n",
    "minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 - Data distribution (balanced) \n",
    "\n",
    "<img  align=\"middle\" src=\"../week-2/figure2_distribution-balanced.png\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "### - Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several issues which are needed to be addressed during the data cleaning. One issue\n",
    "is many cells with missing values. The other issue with these missing values is that they are\n",
    "widely spread within 19 columns out of 38 columns in the dataset coming with a “NaN” mark.\n",
    "As this distribution ratio is considerably high, the replacement of the missing data with\n",
    "reasonable new values is a better option as far as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other issue is the presence of both numerical and categorical data in the dataset. To this\n",
    "effect, the replacement is done by the frequency for the categorical variables and by mean for\n",
    "the numerical values. The missing categorical values that are replaced by the largest frequency\n",
    "belongs to the columns WEATHER, SPEEDING, LIGHTCOND, ROADCOND,JUNCTIONTYPE, INATTENTIONIND, COLLISIONTYPE, and ADDRTYPE. The missing numeric values in columns X and Y are replaced by the mean of the belonging columns, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "What should be also taken into account, specifically for processing the data in the next steps,is\n",
    "the incompatibility of categorical variables with the predictive model analysis tools. For example, to develop regression models and being able to use packages such as Sklearn, these variables are converted into indicator variables during the data cleaning after handling the missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a closer look into the dataset reveals that many of the columns contain inter-organizational codes which are not relevant to the case of this study and are deleted. These\n",
    "columns include OBJECTID, INCKEY, COLDETKEY, REPORTNO, INTKEY, EXCEPTRSNCODE, SDOT_COLCODE, SDOTCOLNUM, ST_COLCODE, ST_COLDESC, SEGLANEKEY, and CROSSWALKKEY. For example, the column SDOT_COLCODE refers to the codes given to the collision by SDOT or the columns INCKEY and COLDETKEY contain the ESRI unique identifier and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the columns also consist of redundant or not enough useful information. For example,\n",
    "there is a second SEVERITYCODE.1 in addition to the SEVERITYCODE which will be deleted.\n",
    "The redundancy in data is also observed for columns such as EXCEPTRSNDESC with no\n",
    "description. The other example is the column UNDERINF which addresses the question:”\n",
    "Whether or not a driver involved was under the influence of drugs or alcohol?” There is however\n",
    "another column named INATTENTIONIND addressing the question: “Whether collision was due\n",
    "to inattention?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of attention in people is usually decreased upon consuming drugs or alcoholic drinks.\n",
    "Accordingly, UNDERINF is deleted and INATTENTIONIND is remained to count for the level of\n",
    "attention. The same analogy is considered for the column LOCATION, as both the X (longitude)\n",
    "and Y (latitudes) are given. Working with X and Y coordinates has also the advantage of a more\n",
    "precise description of the places where the accident occurred. For more clarity, X and Y are also\n",
    "renamed to LONGITUDE and LATITUDE. The same analogy is also considered for the columns\n",
    "STATUS, INCDATE, INCDTTM, SDOT_COLDESC, PEDROWNOTGRNT, ST_COLDESC, PEDCYLCOUNT, HITPARKEDCAR, SEVERITYDESC, ADDRTYPE, and PEDCOUNT. The 10 features selected at the end of this step are listed in Table 1.\n",

    "## Methodology <a name=\"method\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Data Labeling \n",
    "In this section, an overview of the methodology employed in this work is discussed. After the\n",
    "features are selected, they are applied for an explanatory data analysis to figure out more about\n",
    "their effects on the severity of the accidents. The focus is on identifying the feature conditions\n",
    "that have a bigger effect on the severity which leads to injuries. To do so, the data set is filtered\n",
    "and the values of features that correspond to this level of severity are sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latitude and longitude are firstly paired as the coordinates of accident locations and are\n",
    "assigned to a new data frame. The Folium package is imported, and looping is done in which a\n",
    "feature group plus a circle marker is employed to gain a map of Seattle with the points\n",
    "representing the locations of the accidents. \n",
    "\n",
    "### - Data Exploration\n",
    "After the visualization, data exploration is followed by investigating the proportions of other\n",
    "features. Pie charts are used to display the numeric proportions by dividing a circle into\n",
    "proportional slices. The different conditions of weather (clear, raining, overcast, and other) are\n",
    "firstly investigated to figure out which one and to how much percent has mostly contributed to\n",
    "severe accidents. The number of persons (o, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and more) involved with the accident\n",
    "is then studied. Subsequently, the effect of vehicle count (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and more) is studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Data Modeling \n",
    "In the next step, the features are processed for predictive modeling analysis, in which various\n",
    "supervised machine learning algorithms are checked to build the model. For this purpose, the\n",
    "data is normalized, and after the train-test-split, classification techniques are implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "### - K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "The first algorithm being implemented is the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The KNN works based on\n",
    "the classification concerning the K nearest points in the vicinity of the point to be predicted.\n",
    "Since the KNN algorithm is robust regarding the search space and therefore the classes do not\n",
    "have to be linearly separable, it is chosen in this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Decision Tree\n",
    "The 2nd algorithm is the decision tree, in which every internal node is a representation of a test\n",
    "on an attribute, each branch is the representation of the outcome of the test, and each leaf node\n",
    "is the representation of a class label. This flowchart-like technique is famous for its high accuracy\n",
    "and is less sensitive to missing values and non-scaled data. Accordingly, it is used for the\n",
    "classification in this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Logistic Regression\n",
    "The 3rd algorithm used in this work is logistic regression. It passes the input through the\n",
    "logistic/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability. This algorithm has good training\n",
    "abilities and its relatively good capacity for avoiding overfitting issues are the reasons for being\n",
    "employed in this project. The last selected classification technique is Random Forest. Random\n",
    "Forest works based on constructing a multitude of decision trees and because of its capacity to\n",
    "judge the interaction between different features (to come out with higher dimensional features\n",
    "data) it is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Random Forest\n",
    "Random Forest technique also gives the possibility to get an overview of the most important\n",
    "features. To get the benefit of this possibility, after being done with the modeling using the\n",
    "Random Forest classifier, this classifier is employed for giving an estimation of the most\n",
    "important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the training and testing of the above-mentioned algorithms are done, they are tested and\n",
    "evaluated using the accuracy measure, by the calculation of the number of correct predictions\n",
    "and the total number of predictions ratio. The results of the predictive modeling analysis and\n",
    "related tests are gathered in the Modeling, Testing and Evaluation Section."

Adding more data to the dataset can help to compensate for the missing values. Gathering more data about other parameters such as the age of the drivers can also help to gain a more detailed insight into the car accident severity."
